          various statutes as amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000. This Privacy Policy does not require any physical, electronic or digital signature.</p>

          by clicking on the I accept tab or by use of the website or by other means) and will govern the relationship between you and THE RANDOM STORE for your use of the website “<strong>Website</strong>” (defined below).</p>
        <p>This document is published and shall be construed in accordance with the provisions of the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data of information) rules, 2011 under Information
          Technology Act, 2000; that require publishing of the Privacy Policy for collection, use, storage and transfer of sensitive personal data or information.</p>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully by using the Website, you indicate that you understand, agree and consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Website.</p>
        <p>By providing us with your Information or by making use of the facilities provided by the Website, You hereby consent to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of any or all of Your Personal Information and Non-Personal
          Information by us as specified under this Privacy Policy. You further agree that such collection, use, storage and transfer of Your Information shall not cause any loss or wrongful gain to you or any other person.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff4c68;">USER INFORMATION</strong><strong> </strong></p>

        <p>Such information will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely available and accessible in the public domain or is furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005 or any other law for the time being in force.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff4c68;">COOKIES</strong><br />To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use &#8220;cookies&#8221;, or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random
          number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user&#8217;s individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who
          you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard
          drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.</p>
        <p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer&#8217;s connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet
          know where to send you data &#8212; such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users,
          to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff4c68;">LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES</strong><br />Our policy discloses the privacy practices for our own web site only. Our site provides links to other websites also that are beyond our control. We shall in no way be
          responsible in way for your use of such sites.<strong>5. </strong></p>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff4c68;">INFORMATION SHARING</strong><br />We share the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <p><strong>(a)</strong> When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber
          incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(b)</strong> We propose to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients
          of such information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #ff4c68;">INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br />We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
          reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
        <p>All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as
          effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
          Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.</p>
        <p>However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under
          which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>
